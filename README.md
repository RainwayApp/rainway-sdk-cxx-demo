# C++ Demo app

This is a simple example app that shows how to 
initialize and use the C++ bindings for the Rainway SDK.

## Build instructions

First, get your native Rainway SDK and put it in `runtime/` folder.
Then you can build by doing:

```shell
# Build CMake directory
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
# Build with CMake
cmake --build .
```
